# Boston-house-price-prediction
The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house in Boston, our machine learning model must predict the house price. To train our machine learning model with boston housing data, we will be using scikit-learnâ€™s boston dataset.  In this dataset, each row describes a boston town or suburb.
